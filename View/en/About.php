<h3 class="page-header">OTHER CLIMATES</h3>

<p>
    The next conference on climate will be held in Paris in 2015.<br>
    It is not a scoop. Climate is changing, leading to increasing economical, 
    political and ecological instabilities.
</p>

<p>
    But is climate the only thing to change?<br>
    And what about the other climates we are struggling with everyday?
</p>

<div id="about-climat" class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-5">
  
    <p>
        <em><strong>How is social climate changing ?</strong></em><br>
        As climate is getting tense, sharpened, rigidified, we are going through showers of instability, 
        storms of social insecurity, the freezing of ideals and illusions.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em><strong>How is the economical climate changing?</strong></em><br>
        It is striking us with the sinking of unemployment, the rise of insecure jobs, 
        carrying more and more wrecks of homeless or unemployed people, “illegal” immigrants, without any ties...
    </p>

    <p>
        <em><strong>How is the educational system changing?</strong></em><br>
        It is deregulating, getting more and more individualized from the bottom to the top.<br>
        It is bringing to us torrents of early evaluation, boredom, suffered orientations, rains of failure and glaciations of social reproduction.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <em><strong>And how are WE changing ?</strong></em> as we are constantly compelled to adjust 
        to pointless changes and nothing is really changing.

<div id="about-climat" class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-5">

    <p>
        In 2012, The Rio Conference offered an opportunity to shed light on the multiple components of 
        sustainable development and led everybody to question his/her personal and professional practices.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The project « RIO 2012 », conducted by the organizations mentioned below was not only aiming at talking about 
        the preparation and running of the Conference, but also to use the 15 months before the Conference to discuss 
        the implementation of sustainable development in relation with various themes and various areas of the world.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This project had three main goals: train, inform and favor exchanges, and thus the objectives and means resulting of it.
    </p>
    
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-1">
    <img src="http://www.toutsurlenvironnement.fr/files/imagecache/image_actu_full/actu/RIO20_fond_bleu.jpg" 
         class="img img-responsive"
         id="about-historique-img">
  </div>
</div>

<p>
    In relation with the third goal « favor exchanges », INDP initiated a specific project: « Demain la Terre, la jeunesse prend la parole » 
    (Tomorrow the Earth, the Youth is speaking), whose main purpose was to enrich the Conference with the thoughts of the young generations.
</p>

<p>
    From Europe, Asia, Africa, North America and South America, from kinder garden to universities, from the cities to the rural areas, 
    young citizens got involved to express their points of view, elaborate proposals and projects and relay their hopes and difficulties 
    to the politicians and persons in charge from the various countries participating to the Conference.
</p>

<p>
    In 2015, « Other Climates » is placing itself in the continuity of « Rio 2012 », and would like to take advantage of the media coverage 
    of the Climate Conference to show that citizens’ initiatives already have success.<br>
    The final purpose is to present a report of the experiences and solutions already found to cast away the general feeling of powerlessness.

<p>
    Associations and researchers will exchange with the coordinators on a regular basis.<br>
    Other Climates presents the projects on its website autresclimats.com and its facebook page.
</p>

<p>
    At the end of those few months of discussion and research, participants will meet in November 2015 in Chilly-Mazarin 
    for Other Climates congress to be held in parallel with the World Climate Conference in Paris.
    This event will mark the culmination of the project through lectures, debates, artistic performances and
    photo exhibitions around the actions carried out by members of other climates.
</p>

<p>
    This will be a large audience manifestation to communicate about citizen initiatives that have proven themselves, 
    to inspire new initiatives and encourage today citizens to take (back) control of their destiny for a fairer and
    more united future and to build a people-centered development model.
